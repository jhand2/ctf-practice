**Disclaimer**: I found this kind of boring so this readme just contains
the answer outright without any real explanation.

This was about half reverse engineering the functionality of eatch

The answer to input is 341eat009. The way to solve this is a little too
brute force so I don't intend to do a real write-up to explain.
